He said &quot;Is it reasonable to have the POC Aug 10-14th if all the equipment arrives Fri or Mon?&quot;  I told him that is highly unlikely.  I told him that this is less than two weeks away.  We need time to develop the POC and build it.  I told him that Aug 24th week would probably be more feasible.<br><br>I told him who he needs to email the tracking information for the gear coming from demo depot, and there is also gear coming from KC cisco office, as all the gear was not provided by demo depot.<br><br>I told him to focus on the test plan and diagram.  I told him he needs to update the diagram with actual device models, and where it is coming from (WWT, Cisco demot depot, Cisco KC office)  I told him to put the actual ports on the diagram as well.  Also, where the IXIA points of entry are.  <br><br>I walked through some of the test plan with him and I told him it is very vague.  I will talk with Joe and Dave H about this test plan and we will advise you.  We will most likely have additional questions that I did not cover.<br></p><p><hr></p><p><strong>brandon.swagman@wwt.com</strong> 7/14/2015 11:38 AM</p><p>WWT account team continues to work with Wash U to create this test plan.</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>brandon.swagman@wwt.com</strong> 7/14/2015 11:17 AM</p><p>Sent email to Derek and Dave H. checking status of the test plan.  </p><p><hr></p><p><strong>aaron.freidenberg@wwt.com</strong> 7/10/2015 10:49 AM</p><p>*************Summary Note**************<br>Sorry I did not put this in sooner.  Right now, this is what is happening...<br>There is gear that is shipping from Cisco Demo Depot which will allow us to build the ACI fabric scenario that Wash U needs to use.  We are using a combination of WWT ACI gear and Cisco Demo Depot gear to build the fabric.  Teammate Dave Harrison will help build the test plan, which is currently in process.  I am in the process of getting the latest diagram which was agreed upon by Wash U.</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>brandon.swagman@wwt.com</strong> 7/10/2015 10:05 AM</p><p>no response received on previous email.  Will follow up on Monday 7/13 if we still do receive a response.</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>brandon.swagman@wwt.com</strong> 7/8/2015 8:22 AM</p><p>follow up email sent</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>brandon.swagman@wwt.com</strong> 7/8/2015 8:17 AM</p><p>I will take this as a no and send a follow up email to the account team working on this engagement.</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>brandon.swagman@wwt.com</strong> 7/7/2015 12:43 PM</p><p>Anyone heard any updates about this engagement or should I send a follow up email to the CSE?</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>aaron.freidenberg@wwt.com</strong> 7/1/2015 8:57 AM</p><p>Had a call last night with the AM Matt Ortbal, and he said the rest of the equipment will be procured by Cisco.  I gave him the shipping information to send the gear to.  Meghan is now working with the Cisco SE Jeff Humphreys for coordination of that effort.</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>aaron.freidenberg@wwt.com</strong> 7/1/2015 8:56 AM</p><p>I had another call with Bob Watson who only wanted to talk about equipment.  I explained to him where we are at with equipment, and how Cisco is trying to get the rest of the gear from Demo Depot.  He basically wanted to have a backup plan just in case Cisco cannot produce the rest of the equipment.  He started to ask about our ACI demo environment and ACI training class equipment, and in so many words I told him to go to the practice lead Bruce Clounie to speak about that gear.  He makes the ultimate decision.</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>aaron.freidenberg@wwt.com</strong> 6/23/2015 2:55 PM</p><p>We had initial call with CSE Derek Legler and discussed a multitude of questions. Specifically what was taken away from this meeting is that CSE Derek Legler needs to establish a diagram and test plan with the customer.  He needs to meet with Wash U and really get down to what they absolutely want to see.  I asked about the potential sale and he said WashU is looking at an ACI bundle, and possibly a second one for another data center (eventually).  So initial buy potential is Standard Cisco Nexus ACI bundle.</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>aaron.freidenberg@wwt.com</strong> 6/23/2015 2:53 PM</p><p>POC WashU ACI<br>CSE:Derek Legler<br>billing number: 117940<br>Opp: Wash U - Research Network ACI<br>ATCPOC0001509<br>ATC0008433</p><p><hr></p></div>
